== Description ==

### The iPerceptions Survey WordPress plugin is the best way to deploy a customer feedback survey solution on a WordPress-based website. ###

With an iPerceptions survey you can:

* Increase conversion by better understanding what your visitors  want

* Head off negative social media by creating a direct dialog with visitor

* Better engage visitors by tracking and measuring their level of engagement with different content

iPerceptions launches survey invitations using a line of javascript, placed just above the closing body tag of any page. 

Once the plugin is installed, you need to obtain your iPerceptions Survey script. To obtain your iPerceptions Survey code, first log into your iPerceptions account, or create one for free, in the [iPerceptions Portal](https://ips-portal.iperceptions.com/login.aspx?c=). Select your survey and click on "Collect --> Invitation Code". Copy the code into the box on the iPerceptions Survey plugin configuration page, found in the Wordpress Admin menu under Settings, and push "save".

You now have two options for code placement: across the entire site, or on a page by page basis.

To place the code on every page of your site, check the box on the iPerceptions Survey plugin configuration window. If you would prefer to deploy the code on a page-by-page basis, there is an iPerceptions Survey menu located at the bottom of the "Edit Page" interface. Simply check the "enable iPerceptions on this page" box, and the iPerceptions javascript will be included on that page.

Remember, the plugin only controls which page(s) your iPerceptions Survey invites people from. Controlling the invitation rate and on/off status of the script itself needs to be done through the iPerceptions Survey website itself.

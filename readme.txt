The best way to place your 4Q Survey on a WordPress website. Place the code site-wide, or on a page by page basis.


== Description ==

The 4Q Survey WordPress plugin is the best way to deploy the 4Q Survey solution on a WordPress-based website.

4Q launches survey invitations using a line of javascript, placed just above the closing body tag of any page. As WordPress doesn't allow the direct editing of pages in this manner, the 4Q Survey plugin takes care of this javascript injection for you.

Once the plugin is installed, you need to obtain your 4Q Survey script. To obtain your 4Q Survey code, first log into your 4Q account. Select your survey and click on "Publish > Get Survey Code". Copy the code into the box on the 4Q Survey plugin configuration page and push "save".

You now have two options for code placement: across the entire site, or on a page by page basis.

To place the code on every page of your site, check the box on the 4Q Survey plugin configuration window. If you would prefer to deploy the code on a page-by-page basis, there is a 4Q Survey menu located on the right hand side of the "Edit Page" interface. Simply check the "enable 4Q on this page" box, and the 4Q javascript will be included on that page.

Remember, the plugin only controls which page(s) your 4Q Survey invites people from. Controlling the invitation rate and on/off status of the script itself needs to be done through the 4Q Survey website itself.

== Installation ==

1. Download/upload the plugin to your WordPress plugins directory (typically "wp-content/plugins")
2. Activate the plugin using the Plugin Admin Dashboard
3. 4Q Survey will have been added to the left-nav interface in WordPress.
4. Enter your 4Q Survey code into the 4Q Survey plugin configuration screen
5. Choose to toggle site wide (from the configuration screen), or only on specific pages (from the edit-page interface of the pages you desire).
